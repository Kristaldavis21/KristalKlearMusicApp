            Keyshia Cole is an American singer, songwriter, entrepreneur, and
        television personality. Nominated for the Grammy Awards four times,
        Cole was passionate about music from her childhood, and did some
        recording with Bay Area resident MC Hammer when she was only 12. <br>

        Her music career took off in the early 2000s when she sang on Messy
        Marv's ‘Nubian Queen’ remix. Critics praised her voice for having a
        good range of R&B tones, with a husky texture and soulfulness. The
        R&B singer then worked her way up the music industry ladder with
        sheer determination and hard work. <br>
        
        Her lyrics usually touch upon topics like empowerment, love, and heartbreak. 
        Mostly all her albums have been critically and commercially successful. 
        Besides her music career, she had also ventured into reality television, 
        but as her music career took off, her career in television took a backseat.

        Keyshia is also an astute businesswoman, and has been praised for
        her fashion sense. Handling her success with a degree of modesty,
        she says that success would never change her as a person and if it
        ever does, then she would prefer to leave the music industry.
